    // When you get something done you can delete the line. //
    // You can add a line f you think of something that     //
    // NEEDS to get done but you don't have time or don't   //
    // know how to do it at right now.                      //

    // The changes I suggest here are to help learn OO development //
    // as well as good coding practices. IMHO of course            //
    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    
    1. (RobotTemplate) Change "lastLoadButtonState" to none static
       Fix BallHandler to do the right thing
    
    2. (GlobalVariables) Add comments to describe what each variable means
    
    3. (HardwarePortsEnum) Add new lines for Module numbers, etc
       we might need to use different constructors in many of the
       classes, especially those things that are NOT on Digital Side car
            DoubleSolenoid
            DigitalInput (?)
    
    4. Need to develop camera code
    
    5. (DriveSystem) Need to add fudge factors where we use y=mx+b code
       Need to add a variable for "b" (y offset). Hopefully the "m" slope
       is already a variable.
    
    6. (Anchor) move anchorRaiseTime to GlobalVariables
    
    7. Need to get LiveWindows or SmartDashboard working with all
       the variables we have in GlobalVariables
    
    8. Need to update User's Manual -- there have been lots of changes
       lately.
    
    9. Figure out if we could control the CompressorSystem and add code
       to allow the pressure to go lower than the low limit -- we might
       be able to save some battery power.
    
    10. (DriveSystem) Use HardwarePortsEnums for motor channels
    
    11. (DriveSystem) Fix bug "if (distanceToMoveInFeet > - 5)"
    
    12. (RobotTemplate) IMHO -- don't use constants, define the joystick
        button numbers in GlobalVariables
    
    13. (Shooter) put wait time constants in GlobalVariables
    
    14. (SideArms) put wait time constants in GlobalVariables
    
    15. (all) figure out how to measure hardware execution speeds.
        Put code in to turn ON port at the beginning of a section of code
        and put code in to turn OFF a port at the end. Then we can monitor
        this with the oscilliscope.
    
    16. I think we should change GlobalVariables to just "Globals".
    
    17. I would like to build a "test harness" to be able to run/debug this
        code before we get hardware. Just need to figure out how to do it.
    
    18. Need to add Global variable for adjusting the gyro sensitivity.
        Default is 0.007 (as per 2010 code).
    
    19.
